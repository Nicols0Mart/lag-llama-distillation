____
This repository houses the Lag-Llama architecture.

<b>Current Features:</b>

üí´ <b>Zero-shot forecasting</b> on a dataset of <b>any frequency</b> for <b>any prediction length</b>, using the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13HHKYL_HflHBKxDWycXgIUAHSeHRR5eo?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Colab Demo.</a><br/>

____

Coming Soon:

‚≠ê An <b>online gradio demo</b> where you can upload time series and get zero-shot predictions.

‚≠ê Features for <b>finetuning</b> the foundation model

‚≠ê Features for <b>pretraining</b> Lag-Llama on your own large-scale data

‚≠ê Scripts to <b>reproduce</b> all results in the paper.
